# Python_BB_Biomaterials
    A Python-based implementation of the Bergström-Boyce and time-temperature superposition model applied to various plant biomaterials with Qinghai-Tibet Plateau climate data; featured in D. R. Musk's Applying the Bergström-Boyce Model to Cell Wall Biopolymers with Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Climate Data. Computational procedure is documented; to evaluate other polymers, input appropriate chemical structure data after function definitions. Graphs are generated with Matplotlib.
